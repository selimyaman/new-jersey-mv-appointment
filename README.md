# New Jersey MVC Appointment Finder
MVC appointments are notoriously hard to find in NJ. This Python script lets you scrape the appointments, and emails you when someone cancels his/her appoitnment.

You can spesifcy the locations you want to have an appoitnment.

You can customize which type of appoitnment you want.

And then it emails you when the script is run.

So the best use of this would be setting up with chrontab - where it'll be run regularly (I would prefer every few minutes).
