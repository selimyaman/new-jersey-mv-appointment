# New Jersey MVC Appointment Finder

MVC appointments are notoriously hard to find in NJ. This Python script lets you scrape the appointments and emails you when someone cancels his/her appointment.

You can specify the locations you want to have an appointment.

You can customize which type of appointment you want.

And then it emails you when the script is run.

So the best use of this would be setting up with crontab - where it'll be run regularly (I would prefer running every few minutes).
